# Project 1: Domain Q&A Chatbot

- Due: Feb 23
- Groups: Up to 2 students
- Submit on CourseWorks: GitHub repo link + live deployed URL

## Goal

Build and deploy a chatbot that answers questions in a narrow domain, and prove it works using
an automated eval harness.

## What you must demonstrate

- Few-shot prompting (≥3 examples)
- Clear scope using positive constraints (no “don’t do X”)
- A way to handle uncertainty (escape hatch)
- At least 1 deterministic metric
- At least 10 golden-reference MaaJ evals (judge compares to an expected answer)
- At least 10 rubric MaaJ evals (judge grades against a rubric)

## Requirements

### 1) App

- Pick a niche topic narrow enough to write 20+ test questions.
- Backend: FastAPI
- Frontend: simple web UI
- Deploy on GCP and provide a live URL

### 2) Prompt

Your promptng strategy must include:

- Role/persona (domain voice + boundaries)
- Few-shot examples (≥3)
- You may statically fix or dynamically load your examples
- Organizaton method of your choice
- Positive constraints (define what it can answer)
- Escape hatch (what to do when unsure)

### 3) Out-of-scope handling

- Define 3+ out-of-scope categories using positive framing
- Add a Python backstop after generation (keyword/regex/simple classifier) to catch misses
  - A great example of this would be safety handling, detect distressed keywords and
    fallback into a different prompt.

### 4) Evaluation harness

Create:

- A golden dataset with 20+ cases:
  - 10 in-domain (with expected answer)
  - 5 out-of-scope (with expected refusal behavior)
  - 5 adversarial/safety-trigger
- A runnable eval script that:
  - runs all tests
  - reports pass/fail per test
  - prints pass rates by category
  - includes:
    - ≥1 deterministic metric (regex/keywords/refusal detection)

## Repo contents

- README.md (topic, how to run locally, link to live URL)
- pyproject.toml (it must be uv -based)
- app code (FastAPI + frontend)
- eval (single command to run specified in README.md )
